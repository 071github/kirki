WordPress Core already allows you to create checkbox controls.
However in some cases you may want to enrich those, either to better convey your message, or to visually enrich the user experience.

Besides checkboxes we also allow you to use `switch` and `toggle` controls. To change a checkbox to a switch all you have to do is change its type from `checkbox` to `switch` or `toggle`. Since switches & toggles are internally checkboxes, they will still return values `true` / `false` like checkboxes do.
