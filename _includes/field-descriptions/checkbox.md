Checkboxes provide a simple way to turn on/off options. They return a `boolean` so you can easily check their value in your code and act on them (check the examples for more details).

If a checkbox is not what you're after visually, you can also use a [`switch`](/docs/controls/switch) or a [`toggle`](/docs/controls/toggle). They are both internally checkboxes, so you use them the exact same way, their only difference is the way they present the options.
