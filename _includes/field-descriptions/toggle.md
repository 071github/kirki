Toggles provide a simple way to turn on/off options. They return a `boolean` so you can easily check their value in your code and act on them (check the examples for more details).

Toggle controls are internally [`checkbox`](/docs/controls/checkbox) controls styled differently, inspired from Google's [Material Design Switches](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/selection-controls.html#selection-controls-switch).
