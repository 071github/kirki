Exactly the same as **select** controls.

The only difference is that the field `type` is defined as `dropdown-pages` and it will show a list of your pages.

The default value for dropdown-pages controls can be a page ID (int).

example: `'default' => 42,`
The returned value is the ID of the selected page.
