# tooltip

Using the `tooltip` argument you can add tooltips to your controls. We recommend using descriptions instead of tooltips as descriptions are always visible while tooltips require the user to hover the `( i )` icon next to the control in order to see the details. However, in some cases where you want to add a simple description and then some additional information that will solve a few questions from users you can use the tooltips to solve that issue.

Note: This argument was called `help` in versions < 2.2.
For backwards-compatibility purposes we're keeping compatibility with the `help` argument but we would advise you to migrate your code to the new argument.
